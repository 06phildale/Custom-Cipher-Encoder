# Custom Cipher Encoder

## Objective

The Custom Cipher Encoder project was designed to implement a Caesar-style cipher in Python, allowing users to encode messages by shifting letters in the alphabet. The application handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, while leaving spaces and punctuation unchanged. This project demonstrates practical skills in string manipulation, algorithm implementation, and creating user-friendly command-line interfaces.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing character encoding algorithms and understanding cipher logic.  
- Handling string manipulation for both uppercase and lowercase letters.  
- Preserving non-alphabetic characters in encoded output.  
- Writing modular Python code with reusable functions.  
- Enhancing code readability and maintainability through comments and descriptive variable names.

## Steps

*Ref 1: Program Startup*  
Displays a prompt for the user to input the message they want to encode and the shift amount.

*Ref 2: Encoding Function*  
Demonstrates the function that shifts letters by a fixed number, handling wrap-around from 'z' to 'a'.

*Ref 3: Handling Uppercase, Lowercase, and Non-Alphabetic Characters*  
Shows how the program maintains capitalization and preserves spaces, numbers, and punctuation.

*Ref 4: Output*  
Prints the encoded message in a clear, user-friendly format for the user to view.
